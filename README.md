# Cryptopals Solutions in C++
## Introduction
[Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) is a set of cryptographic challenges, which teach "how cryptosystems are built, but also how they're attacked".

I decided to implement them in C++.

## Code Layout
* `sets/`: The challenges' solutions, divided into sets
* `utils/`: The various utils I used in order to solve the challenges
* `tests/`: The challenges' tests and utils't tests

## Challenges I solved

* Set1 - 6/8 challenges
